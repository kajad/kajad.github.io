### About me
I am an applied linguist and researcher specializing in the design and evaluation of language resources and technologies, with a focus on their application in corpus linguistic research.

I currently split my time between [Centre for Language Resources and Technologies](https://www.cjvt.si/en/) at the University of Ljubljana, and [Department for Artificial Intelligence](https://ailab.ijs.si/) at the Jožef Stefan Institute.

For more info, see my <a href="https://kajad.github.io/pdf/cv_kd_2025-01_en.pdf" target="_blank">full CV here</a>, or view my profiles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KWq-H4AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kaja-Dobrovoljc).

### Research areas
- Corpus annotation and analysis
- Language technology and evaluation
- Language description and variation

A common thread in my work is the use of state-of-the-art resources and tools for data-driven exploration of how language functions in different communicative settings. While the topics have ranged widely (from morphology, syntax, and lexis to semantics, discourse, and formulaic language) they share a focus on empirical analysis grounded in richly annotated corpora. I also apply this expertise in the development, training, and evaluation of language technologies of various kinds.

### Recent news

- June 2025: It's a wrap! The [SPOT project](https://spot.ff.uni-lj.si/) officially comes to an end, leaving behind new data, tools, and methods for studying speech through parsed corpora.
- February 2025: Kick-off of the [AI4DH Centre of Excellence](https://ai4dh.eu/), where we’re joining forces across disciplines to help researchers in the humanities and social sciences integrate AI into their work through tailored infrastructure, training and collaboration.
- November 2024: Err, well ... We’ve just released a bigger, better, and more polished version of the [SST UD](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Slovenian-SST) treebank, to be used in linguistic and NLP research on Slovenian speech. Embedded in [ROG](http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1992), it also features prosody, disfluency and dialogue act annotations.
- October 2024: Excited to announce that [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/) will take place in Ljubljana in August 2025-bringing together five workshops—TLT, UDW, DepLing, IWPT, and Quasy—and two [UniDive](https://unidive.lisn.upsaclay.fr/doku.php?id=ljubljana) pre-conference events.
