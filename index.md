## In short

I am a linguist/researcher interested in the design, annotation and evaluation of **digital language resources**, and their use in **corpus linguistic research**. I currently split my time between [Department of Translation](https://prevajalstvo.ff.uni-lj.si/en) at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, [Laboratory for Cognitive Modelling](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratory/lkm) at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, and [Department for Artificial Intelligence](https://ailab.ijs.si/) at the Jožef Stefan Institute.
