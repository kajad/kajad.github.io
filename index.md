### About me
I am a linguist and researcher specializing in the design and evaluation of language resources and technologies, with a focus on their application in corpus linguistic research.

I currently split my time between [Department of Slovene Studies](https://slov.ff.uni-lj.si/en) at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, and [Department for Artificial Intelligence](https://ailab.ijs.si/) at the Jožef Stefan Institute.

For more info, see my <a href="https://kajad.github.io/pdf/cv_kd_2025-01_en.pdf" target="_blank">full CV here</a>, or view my profiles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KWq-H4AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kaja-Dobrovoljc).

### Recent news


- November 2024: Err, well ... We’ve just released a bigger, better, and more polished version of the [SST UD](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Slovenian-SST) treebank, to be used in linguistic and NLP research on Slovenian speech. Embedded in [ROG](http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1992), it also features prosody, disfluency and dialogue act annotations.
- October 2024: Excited to announce that [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/) will take place in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in August 2025! This biennial conference series brings together five workshops—TLT, UDW, DepLing, IWPT, and Quasy—and will be co-located with the [1st UniDive Shared Task](https://unidive.lisn.upsaclay.fr/doku.php?id=other-events:msp) on Morphosyntactic Parsing.
- July 2024: Release of [STARK](https://github.com/clarinsi/STARK) v3 – a significantly enhanced version of this versatile tool for bottom-up linguistic analysis and comparison of UD treebanks.
